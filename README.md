## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of climate data and leverages machine learning techniques to predict future weather patterns. The project is designed to aid in understanding climate change and its impact on various regions around the world. We utilize Google Cloud services to build a data pipeline and predictive model.

## Data Sources

- **Archived Data:** Historical weather data extracted from various websites.
- **Real-Time Data:** Daily weather data fetched from an API.

## Data Pipeline

The project employs a data pipeline to process and transform the data. Key steps include:

1. **Data Ingestion:** Data is collected from both archived sources and real-time API feeds.
2. **Data Transformation:** Data is cleansed, standardized, and enriched for analysis.
3. **Data Storage:** The transformed data is stored in a central repository (BigQuery).
4. **Data Analysis:** Advanced analytics are performed on the stored data.

## Machine Learning Model

To predict weather patterns, we use an AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model:

1. **Model Training:** The ARIMA model is trained using historical data.
2. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated for accuracy.
3. **Model Deployment:** The final model is deployed for weather prediction.

## Key Findings

- **Top Cities by Average Temperature:** We identified the cities with the highest average temperatures, providing insights into regions with consistently warm climates.
- **Top Cities with Extreme Weather Events:** Cities prone to extreme weather events, such as high temperatures, low temperatures, and heavy precipitation, were also analyzed.
- **Greenhouse Gas Emissions by Country:** A comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas emissions by different countries was conducted, shedding light on major contributors to climate change.
- **Years with Highest Emissions in the USA:** The years with the highest greenhouse gas emissions in the USA were identified, helping pinpoint periods of significant environmental impact.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Correlations between various climate variables were studied, revealing relationships between temperature, precipitation, and other factors.
- **Time Series Analysis and Prediction:** Using the ARIMA model, we forecasted weather conditions for the next 30 days, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and machine learning in understanding climate change and predicting weather patterns. The findings offer valuable information for policymakers, scientists, and the general public to work towards mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects.
